# Project Curriculum Vitae

It's my wed-developer extended resume project with all the actual information.
TECH STACK:
- Angular elements and features: data bindings, routing, observables, service with HTTP methods, ng-containers. 
- Separate json file for core static content (imitation of server).
- Material elements: mat-table, mat-card, material-icons, mat-buttons.
- Sandbox with different css, js implementations, animations.

# Installing
There is as usual some sheet of paper with dependencies, so use "npm install --legacy-peer-deps". May need a bit earlier node versions (like 16)

# Build
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the -prod flag for a production build.
